jLamp README

by Jupp Mueller (jupp0r@gmail.com)

1. Overview

This is a project to create a powerful RGBW LED uplight. You can see a
video of the jLamp functionality at https://vimeo.com/37332778

There are many of such designs already, 
but this one aims to differ in some important aspects:

- full control via a web interface
- remote control using an iPhone app
- sound sensitive changing of lamp colors
- very high power LEDs (see hardware section Below)
- efficient driver
- as cheap as possible design
- using open source soft- and hardware where feasible

2. Hardware being used
- Arduino Uno (arduino.cc)
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- 2x LEDengin LZC-A0MD40 Leds

3. Software being used (might change over time)
- Arduino IDE (arduino.cc)
- Webduino Framework (code.google.com/p/webduino)
- Farbtastic (acko.net/dev/farbtastic)
